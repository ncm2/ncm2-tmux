# ncm2-tmux

Provide word completions from other tmux panes for ncm2.

The idea was stolen from
[wellle/tmux-complete.vim](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim), since
I misunderstood its source code and believed that it tends to block vim at the
time I created tmux completion for the old
[nvim-completion-manager](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-completion-manager).

You could use
[wellle/tmux-complete.vim](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim)
directly since it [supports ncm2](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim/pull/83) and
[doesn't block vim actually](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim/commit/c0e1f2b5608a38e4e2ab2895c49f98f7ddfabb65).
